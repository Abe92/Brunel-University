-> Task: 1. Testing python code

	commencing @ 17.35 pm BST
	finished   @ 17.42 pm BST

	what I did:
	(1). Test a 'Pandas' library to open the xtr file which already transform
	     to text file.
	(2). The snippet is as follow:
		
		import pandas
		
		filelist=pandas.read_csv("Drive_name:\\xTR\planeOutTopFirst.txt")
		filelist

	It returns the content of the file such column names and the value of each
	columns. Tried to follow-up with:

		filelist.mean()

	It returns this statement:
		
		'Series([], dtype: float64)

	(3). The first 3 line is working, however the last one that is to calculate mean
	     seems require another 'special statement' to actually display what I need.
	     This what I will have to figure out ASAP 

				or

	     Skip the data analysis part but display the visualization of '3D shapes'

-> Task: 2. Chapter 0 report: Introduction

	commencing @ 13:36 pm BST
	finished   @ 17.07 pm BST

	what I did:

	Wrote a 3/4 page of introduction explaining about:
	(1). Cerebral vasculature and
	(2). Cerebral aneurysm.

	I plan to continue to 'how the study has been conducted to get the data', so there
	will be a connection with the project proposal. Also to point out, this report
	is trying heavily stay true with the project proposal.
