-> Task: Exploring python library

	commencing @ 11.26 am BST
	finished   @ 11.53 am BST

	-outcome: Found a plugin called VPython

	-what is it: (1) A 3D graphics module for Python
		     (2) The module can create 3D objects (such as spheres, curves, etc)
			 and position them in 3D space.
		     (3) Visual, running in a separate thread, automatically updates
			 a 3D scene many times per second, to reflect the current positions
			 of the objects.
		     (4) The programmer does not need to deal with display management,
			 but can focus on the computational aspects of the program.
		     (5) The user can navigate in the 3D scene by using the mouse to
			 zoom and rotate while the program is running. Visual supports
			 full vector algebra.

	-thought(s): I think I can use to build a 'script'/'plugin' around this module
