-> Task: Online questionnaire (Cerebral Vasculature)

	commencing @ 12.48 pm BST
	finished   @ 14.39 pm BST

	to-do: (1) Robin feedback for question 1
		 .'Something can be propretary and free but not necessarily open-source'
	       (2) Sebastian feedback for question 1 + general
		 .'One has to be very careful with open-source vs free software'
		 .'Add a free-form question like "Why are you interested in cerebral
		   vasculature" as one of questions'
		 .'he is not really working in neuroscience but rather haemodynamics
		   simulations'
	
	suggested course of action:
		(1) Change the current options, from:
			(a) Open-source software model (free software)
			(b) Proprietary software model (paid software)
			(c) Mixed

			(a) Open-source libre (free-use, free-of-charge),
			(b) Open-source gratis (limited use, free-of-charge),
			(c) Open-source paid (limited use, paid),
			(d) Closed-source gratis (limited use, free-of-charge),
			(e) Closed-source paid (limited use, paid),
			(f) mixed (e.g. mixed comercial/academic codes,
				multiple programs using different licences)
		
		(2) .Remove the term 'Neuroscience'
		    .Add the free-form question, 'Why are you interested in the study
		     of cerebral vasculature?' or similar question in that context
		     (this could be optional question).
