# Unsupervised learning

Broadly speaking, __unsupervised learning__ helps us discover systemic structures in our data.
It is harder to grasp than __supervised learning__, in that there is generally no precise question and answer.

Here are a few important terms related to _unsupervised learning_:
* __Clustering__: grouping similar points together within __clusters__

* __Density estimation__: estimating a probability density function that can explain the distribution of the data points

* __Dimension reduction__: getting a simple representation of high-dimensional data points by projecting them onto a
                          lower-dimensional space (notably for __data visualization__)
                          
* __Manifold learning__: finding a low-dimensional manifold containing the data points
                          (also known as __nonlinear dimension reduction__)
